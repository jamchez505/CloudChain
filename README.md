# CloudChain
CloudChain is a project with the following goals:

**0)**  Develop a simple blockchain (modeled off of the Bitccoin blockchaain described in Satoshi Nakamoto's original whitepaper).

**1)**  Use the blockchain described in Step 1 to understand the core components and concepts of a blockchain, such as decentralization, immutability, mining, consensus and hashing. Additionally, use this blockchain as a self-education tool, and tool for educating others.

**2)**  Integrate the blockchain with various AWS services, such as EC2, Lambda, VPC, Auto-Scaling, and ELB. The hope here is that, through experimentation with said services, fundamental issues with blockchain (such as scalability, governance, and transaction speed) can be addressed.

Goal 1 has been completed.

Next steps include:


**0)**  Adding instructions for using and running CloudChain.

**1)**  Improving code comments.

**2)**  Adding architecture diagrams.

**3)**  Integrating AWS services.

**4)**  Adding some sort of UI for visualization purposes.
